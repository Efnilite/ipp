### ![Lobbies](https://i.imgur.com/Q9XWVcl.png)

Lobbies are a new way for players to connect and create a community. 
a player or a group of players is playing parkour, they will be in a lobby.

IP+ introduces a way to quickly and easily find these lobbies: the active lobbies menu. 
This is a menu that will display all current lobbies, including the amount of players, 
the current mode and the spectators.

Clicking on a lobby makes a player join. 
If there's no more room, clicking on the lobby will automatically make the player become a spectator.

The owner can also invite players with the new invite menu. 
Since IP 5.0.0, every lobby is joined using a player that's in the lobby. 
If you want to join Efnilite's lobby, type /ip join Efnilite.

If the owner of a lobby doesn't like a player that joined, 
they can be kicked with the Player Management menu. 
The owner can also set the visibility to private.

### ![Singleplayer](https://i.imgur.com/U8Xw8V5.png)

With these new modes, players can spend a lot of time engaging in competitive and fun modes. 
They work great as a way to pass the time. 
You can enable or disable any of these modes in the config. 
Every mode in IP+ has its own leaderboard.

**Practice**

Practice mode allows you to select which type of jumps will appear, 
and the distance between them. 
Players can use this to improve their parkour skills with specific jumps.

**Hourglass**
In Hourglass mode, players can only stand on a block for 0.5 seconds. 
If the player doesn't jump to the next block, the block they're standing on will be set to air. 
The time amount is customizable.

**Speed**

Players get speed 2, with their goal being to keep running as long as possible. 
This mode has no jumping, but the path does change, so players just have to make sure they don't fall off.

**Super Jump**
In Super Jump, players jump from platform to platform. 
The higher their score, the longer the distance is that they have to jump. 
To make 20-block jumps possible, players also get a higher speed level each jump. 
This is the hardest mode in this addon.

**Time Trial**
This mode is based on speedrunning. 
The goal of every player is to reach a score of 100 as quickly as possible 
(this value can be changed in the config). 
All options that change the difficulty are disabled, to create an equal playing ground for all players.

### ![Lobby parkour](https://i.imgur.com/eamlxlK.png)

You can now select a specific area in every world for players to play parkour in. 
This area needs to be at least 30x30x30. 
In this small area, the parkour will be mostly the same as normal. 
No schematics will appear while playing this mode.

**Commands**
- **/ipp lobbygm pos1** - Sets the first position
- **/ipp lobbygm pos2** - Sets the second position
- **/ipp lobbygm save** - Saves the selection you made for the current world.

When you save the area, it will only apply in the world you saved it in. 
If you save your selection in world "Lobby", it won't apply to "world-1".

Players need to use **/parkour join lobby** to join.

### ![New styles](https://i.imgur.com/PUkRF2S.png)

By default, styles in Infinite Parkour use a random material for every parkour block. 
Incremental styles follow the same pattern, every time.

Let's say you have a style with snow, ice and stone.
- Default style: snow, snow, stone, ice, stone, ice, snow
- Incremental style: snow, ice, stone, snow, ice, stone ​

By default, you get 13 incremental styles.
You can change, add your own or remove any style in the IP+ config.
